# New York City Citibike Analysis

## Overview of Project
The overall purpose of this project was to look at the data from the New York City Citibike program to convince investors it would be 
smart to invest in similar program in Des Moines. We then used Tableau to put together a Story that gave plenty information to see how
it could be successful. 

## Results

## Summary

One of the first things you will see is that the majority of rides are well less than one hour. Also, the vast majority riders are subscribers
who are male. Additionally, the most popular times are during weekday rush our and around 10 AM to 6 PM on the weekends. This suggests that
the bikes are popular not only for transportation purposes but also for leisure. One suggestion I have is to add a visualizatioin that shows the
ride duration and time of day and weekday. Intuitively, the durations would be longer on weekends becauset those seem to be more fore leisure
than for transportation purposes. Another suggestion I have is to add a visualization that shows a map and wear the trip durations are longest
and shortest. This way you could compare where people are using the bikes just to travel from point A to point B or are just using the bikes
for exercise or leisure.
